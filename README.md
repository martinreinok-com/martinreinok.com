# Personal Portfolio

## Development guide
This site is built using Eleventy as a static site & hosted on Netify, for free! :).  
Eleventy requires Node (Debian setup):  
https://github.com/nodesource/distributions  
```
#!/bin/bash

# Update package index and install required packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Create the keyrings directory if it doesn't exist
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download and save the NodeSource GPG key
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg

# Set the major Node version you want to install
NODE_MAJOR=20

# Add NodeSource repository
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_$NODE_MAJOR.x nodistro main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list > /dev/null

# Update package index again and install Node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```

Eleventy setup:
```
npm install
npx @11ty/eleventy
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

## Background info
I previously used Wordpress hosted on Bluehost (for 150â‚¬ a year) and sadly that ended up with my website hacked and I had to take it down. 
I never really liked Wordpress as in order to achieve my vision had to use lots of plugins, some of which have only trial versions (such as Elementor) and the building experience felt a bit limited without hacky workarounds (e.g. inner section inside inner section -_- etc.).
My site is only a portfolio as well, there is no backend whatsoever, so Wordpress is a bit overkill for this purpose. Although using a static page also restrics my ability to add a shop to my site in the future, or anything else requiring backend.
